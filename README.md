# formulaapp
 The problem I aimed to solve is that it can be challenging to write formulas in their actual mathematical notation while writing blogs and articles.
 For example, expressing a series like 'a+a^2+a^3+...+a^n-1' in a readable way can be difficult. To address this, I created an app using LaTeX in Streamlit. 
 The app allows users to input their formulas, and it automatically converts them into standard mathematical notation.
